Hello GitHub!
-----------------------------------------------------

If you do it right, open sourcing code is **great advertising** for you and your company. At GitHub we like to talk publicly about libraries and systems we've written that are still closed but destined to become open source. This technique has several advantages. It helps determine what to open source and how much care we should put into a launch. We recently open sourced Hubot, our chat bot, to widespread delight. Within two days it had 500 watchers on GitHub and 409 upvotes on Hacker News. This translates into goodwill for GitHub and more superfans than ever before.

If your code is popular enough to attract outside contributions, you will have created a **force multiplier** that helps you get more work done faster and cheaper. More users means more use cases being explored which means more robust code. Our very own [resque](https://github.com/defunkt/resque) has been improved by 115 different individuals outside the company, with hundreds more providing 3rd-party plugins that extend resque's functionality. Every bug fix and feature that you merge is time saved and customer frustration avoided.
